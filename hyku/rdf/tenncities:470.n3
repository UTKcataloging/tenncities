The Southern Railway Station was built in Knoxville in 1903-1904. It prospered until passenger traffic began to decline in the 1960s. The last passenger train to pass through the station was the \"Birmingham Special,\" which departed on August 12, 1970. The station was renovated in the early 1990s for use by Knoxville architectural firm Bullock, Smith, and Partners, Inc." .
