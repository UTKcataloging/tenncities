<http://utk-metadata-object/tenncities:421> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "First Methodist Episcopal Church was organized shortly after the Civil War by the Reverend J. B. Ford. Their first permanent church, dedicated in 1869, stood on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street. The congregation grew quickly and moved to this structure, located on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Locust Street, in 1894. The building was designed in the Romanesque style by architect H. H. Richardson. The church moved again, this time to the Hugh Sanford property, in 1966 and became First United Methodist Church when the Methodist Church and the United Evangelical Brethren merged in 1968." .
