<http://utk-metadata-object/tenncities:427> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "In early 1892, W. W. Woodruff offered his lot on Deaderick Street and his help raising funds to Knoxville's First Baptist Church in order to organize a new church. The product of these efforts was Centennial Baptist Church (renamed Deaderick Avenue Baptist Church in 1905), which was dedicated on September 13, 1892. The church was destroyed by fire in 1909, but was quickly rebuilt and continued to prosper for many years." .
