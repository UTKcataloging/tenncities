<http://utk-metadata-object/tenncities:452> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School (whose name changed to Tennessee School for the Deaf in 1925) was established in Knoxville in 1844. The original campus was the Churchwell House, but the school soon moved to land donated by C. M. McClung near the center of town. After closing during the Civil War, the school expanded quickly during the Reconstruction Era. By 1922, the institution had outgrown its quarters and moved to what had been the Dickinson Estate in South Knoxville. As in previous years, both the campus and its programs expanded quickly." .
