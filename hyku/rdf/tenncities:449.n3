<http://utk-metadata-object/tenncities:449> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Bluff City, located on the Holston River between Bristol and Johnson City, was originally known as Choate's (also spelled Shoate's) Ford, named for Edward Choate, one of its first white settlers. It was often used as a river crossing as it lay on several popular overland routes. The town's name was changed to Middletown in 1793 and again to Union Depot (later shortened to Union) in 1859 when the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad came through. The town was known as Zollicoffer (for the Confederate general of that name) during the Civil War, but reverted to Union at the war's end. It was finally named Bluff City in 1887 when incorporated." .
