The congregation grew quickly and moved to a larger building on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street in 1860. The area around the church grew more congested as Knoxville grew, and the congregation sold their Market Street property and moved to a new building on the corner of Clinch and Walnut in 1905.

It was originally located at one corner of a rectangular lot with smaller houses in the other three corners, a common frontier design intended to proctect against Indians. After the White family established a farm away from this location, the structure was repurposed as the kitchen wing of the Kennedy residence on State Street. In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence. It changed hands again in 1970, when the City Association of Women's Clubs purchased the home and moved it back to central Knoxville.

The Wonderland Park Hotel and its associated buildings became the Wonderland Club in 1914 when they were sold to a group of private investors from Knoxville. Most of these private owners managed to obtain lifetime leases when the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was created. The majority of these leases were eventually converted to 20-year leases that were later extended to expire in 1992. The Wonderland Hotel ceased operations when its lease expired and collapsed in 2005 while debate over what to do with the historic structures standing in Elkmont raged.

After his death in 1901, C.B. Atkin bought the house and made several additions, including a front portico in the classic colonial style. The structure was demolished in about 1950.|    |still image

General James White built part of the house itself (the first in Knoxville) in 1786. It was originally located at one corner of a rectangular lot with smaller houses in the other three corners, a common frontier design intended to protect against Indians. After the White family established a farm away from this location, the structure was repurposed as the kitchen wing of the Kennedy residence on State Street. In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence. It changed hands again in 1970, when the City Association of Women's Clubs purchased the home and moved it back to central Knoxville. It currently stands near the Knoxville Coliseum and is one of the most visited historical sites in the city.|    |still image

A number of shops moved to locations under the new viaduct, where they prospered for many years. Unfortunately, the structure gradually fell into disrepair and was closed for demolition in November of 2005. It was replaced by a concrete viaduct in late 2006, which remains in use today.|    |still image

It manufactured primarily valves and gages, including a thermostat vital to depth charges during World War I and a part crucial to bomb sights during World War II. The company was later sold to Reynolds Metals and then to Robertshaw and Siebe. It also gradually lost its prominence in the field. In 1994, what remained of the business was purchased by Texas leveraged buyout specialist J. Randal Greaves, and its name was changed to Fulton Bellows and Components to reflect its origins. Now known simply as Fulton Bellows LLC and owned by Morris Capital Management Group (which purchased it in August of 2004), the company continues to operate in Knoxville today.|    |still image

W. Stuart Evans was the original visionary behind the event, which he intended to attract business to central Knoxville and away from suburban shopping malls. This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.|    |still image

During his term, Brownlow convinced the legislature to ratify the 14th Amendment (thus sparing Tennessee from Reconstruction) and made great progress toward restoring the State's economic health.

They built their first church on the west side of Prince (now Market) Street in 1820. The congregation grew quickly and moved to a larger building on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street in 1860. The area around the church grew more congested as Knoxville grew, and the congregation sold their Market Street property and moved to a new building on the corner of Clinch and Walnut in 1905. The congregation eventually outgrew this building as well, and moved to a structure on Kingston Pike in 1957.|    |still image

Nash's original vision, Talahi was to be not just a park but an entire upper-class subdivision in west Knoxville. He acquired land adjoining Knoxville's new Sequoyah Hills neighborhood in 1926 and began marketing it to potential residents in 1929. Only one lot was sold before the Great Depression, which put an end to Nash's dream. After his 1933 suicide, Sequoyah Hills effectively annexed Talahi, which developed with the rest of the area into one of Knoxville's toniest neighborhoods.|    |still image

It was originally located at one corner of a rectangular lot with smaller houses in the other three corners, a common frontier design intended to protect against Indians. After the White family established a farm away from this location, the structure was repurposed as the kitchen wing of the Kennedy residence on State Street. In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence. It changed hands again in 1970, when the City Association of Women's Clubs purchased the home and moved it back to central Knoxville. It currently stands near the Knoxville Coliseum and is one of the most visited historical sites in the city.|    |still image

In 1937, Ralph Berry, Fred Berry, and Edward Weigel founded the Berry Funeral Home on South Gay Street. In 1948, the business expanded when the Berry Funeral Home purchased and remodeled a structure (shown here) on Chapman Highway. A number of other major expansions were made in later years (including a merger with SCI Funeral Services of Tennessee) and Berry Funeral Home continues to operate as one of the most prestigious mortuary services in Tennessee.|    |still image

Ford. Their first permanent church, dedicated in 1869, stood on the corner of Clinch and Market Streets. The congregation grew quickly and moved to this church, located on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Locust Street, in 1894. The building was designed in the Romanesque style by architect H.H. Richardson. The Church moved again, this time to the Hugh Sanford property, in 1966 and became the First United Methodist Church when the Methodist Church and the United Evangelical Brethren merged in 1968.|    |still image

The church's first permanent house of worship stood on Gay Street and was completed in 1850. The congregation split in 1869, and the dissidents formed Knoxville's Second Baptist Church. The First Baptist Church moved to their second home (made possible in large part by merchant and philanthropist W.W. Woodruff) in 1888. Their current house of worship, located at the corner of Walnut and Main Streets, was completed in 1924 and is still in use today. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.|    |still image

It was often used as a river crossing, as it lay on several popular overland routes. The town's name was changed to Middletown in 1793 and again to Union Depot (later shortened to Depot) in 1859 when the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad came through. The town was known as Zollicoffer (for the Confederate general of that name) during the Civil War, but reverted to Union at the War's end. It was finally named Bluff City in 1887.|    |still image

Mrs. Martha Henson donated most of the money for the structure in memory of her late husband, James A. Henson.

The church's first permanent house of worship stood on Gay Street and was completed in 1850. The congregation split in 1869, and the dissidents formed Knoxville's Second Baptist Church. The First Baptist Church moved to their second home (made possible in large part by merchant and philanthropist W.W. Woodruff) in 1888. Their current house of worship, located at the corner of Walnut and Main Streets, was completed in 1924 and is still in use today. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.|    |still image

His zest for confrontation and staunch Union loyalties convinced the Confederacy to expel him from Tennessee during the Civil War, but he returned to Tennessee in March of 1865 when he was elected governor. During his term, Brownlow convinced the legislature to ratify the 14th Amendment (thus sparing Tennessee from Reconstruction) and made great progress toward restoring the State's economic health. He served one term in the US Senate before dying in 1877."|    |still image

After being partially destroyed by fire, this structure was demolished to make way for the Market Street Mall in 1960.|    |still image

Hayes visited Knoxville in 1877, he was honored by a reception at the Lamar House. This establishment was built in 1817, and the Bijou Theatre opened as part of the hotel on March 8, 1909. Over the years, it hosted many famous vaudeville and theater acts. By 2005, however, the Theater was deteriorating and its owners defaulted on their mortgage. Knoxvillians, including Mayor Bill Haslam, banded together to save the Theater and fundraising and renovation efforts are ongoing.|    |still image

This fire, which occurred on April 7, 1897, started in the Hotel Knox and consumed most of the 400 block of Gay Street before being stopped at the Sanford, Chamberlain & Albers Company Building with a firewall. The fire killed three people and a rare white mule (visiting Knoxville with an itinerant circus). The mule's ghost is said to have started a number of small fires in the area since."|    |still image

W. Stuart Evans was the original visionary behind the event, which he intended to attract business to central Knoxville and away from suburban shopping malls. This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.|    |still image
